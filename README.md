# OvOpsetup
ovop setup and download for zip


Hi! Welcome to the official Github for Overly Optimized and other ports and branches.
This will include the ZIP files (mods) for the modpack Overly Optimized, Overly Modded and some other branches. Use at your own risk, the official is OVOP and OVMD.

Setup!
When you first launch, you will get Essentials, just say next and accept. Then go into options ---> Video Settings and change video settings for your device, I cannot make the best config for everyone, so making it yourself is better!

Updating the modpack!
When you want to update the modpack, you would right click on Overly Optimized, view profile, 3 dots, switch version, switch it to a different version, if you want the original feel, use release versions that are not marked with Trim or T. If you want to use the trimmed for better fps for less stuff overall, just use a new profile on your launcher, its easier for you and you dont lose your configs!

Discord Support:
In the description of the project on CurseForge, join the Discord for help and support. Game crash? Bug? Suggestion? Unintended feature? Just join the Discord and @Cart for help. IBW is not the main contributor, he just made the art.
